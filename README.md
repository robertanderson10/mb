### Instructions
Build a rewards points calculator that can be added to a campaign page that will promote a new credit card rewards program.
What to do
Create a front-end calculator to find the total rewards points earned based on a user’s monthly average credit card spend. The only input will be a field for the user’s average monthly credit card spend (ccSpend) and the output is the total rewards points earned (totalPoints) over the course of the first year.
Calculation details
2 rewards points are earned for every $1 spent
8,000 bonus rewards points are earned automatically each year
Example scenario
If the user’s average credit card spend per month is $500, then 12,000 points will be earned over the course of the year. So in the first year, the user would have earned 12,000 points + 8,000 bonus points, totaling 20,000 points.
Please note
Use Bootstrap 4 as a base
You have complete freedom in terms of the calculator layout and design
Make sure the calculator provides a great user experience
Add any flourishes that you think might help entice the customer to use the product
Use Angular 1.7 to build out the controller
